    "        <td>And if you really, really get stuck and you just can't see it, ask a friend, not your friend print(), but your actual friend, a real human. Preferably a developer, but they don't have to be. It could be somebody who's taking the course with you. You could go onto discord and find other students to help you, because after all you're all just leveling up your own programming skills right? The really good thing about asking a friend to look through your code is they won't make the same assumptions that you've made. So they have some fresh eyes that they can look at the code with, and it might be incredibly obvious what's actually happening. And it's really not embarrassing at all. If somebody managed to help you with your code, you can offer to help them the next time when they get stuck. And for the person who's helping you, they're also just working out their programming muscles, right?</td>\n",

    "        <td>And the next tip is to run often. No, you don't have to go exercising to be a good programmer. But what I mean is run your code often. Don't wait until you've written loads and loads of code to hit run and then find out you've got loads of snags and loads of bugs. But run it after every little execution. Once you feel like you've changed the program ever so slightly, run it. Confirm that it's actually doing what you want it to do, because if you leave it all to the end, then you end up with a pile of bugs and you don't know where to start. Now, if you do end up in that situation and you can see multiple bugs at the same time, try to tackle them one at a time instead of trying to do bits and bobs of each. It will really, really help.</td>\n",

    "        <td>And the final tip is, of course, Stack Overflow. I've saved this the last because you really don't want to take every single small bug of yours to Stack Overflow, that's not what it's designed for. Instead, it's really designed as a way of asking other developers when you think that you've come across a bug or an issue that should be unique. Now, if you think that you issue isn't unique and other people should have encountered, then just search Stack Overflow. If you really think that nobody in the world has had an issue that you are having right now, then that's the moment to ask the Stack Overflow. I've worked in a lot of companies where everybody just goes to the part when Stack Overflow is down, because there's just no point. As programmers we use it and we search it so much and it's become a really vital tool in the tool belt. But you only wanna ask a question when you've pretty sure that you've exhausted all other avenues of debugging and you've searched all of Stack Overflow and you finally end up with something very strange and very weird that you want others to help you figure out. So don't worry about creating bugs. It doesn't mean that you are bad programmer. In fact, it's an important part of every programmer's journey. Just as a sort of personal note, there was a point in time where I've really thought that I was not a programmer of code, that I was just programmer of bugs. It seemed like every line of code I wrote was a bug.</td>\n",
