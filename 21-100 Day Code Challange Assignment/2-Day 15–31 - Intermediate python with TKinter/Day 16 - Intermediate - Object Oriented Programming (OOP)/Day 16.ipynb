Well, if you think back to yesterday's project, some of you I'm sure at some point during the project, would have had this feeling of what on earth is going on with my code?<br/><br/>And the reason is because our code is getting more complex, it's trying to do a lot of things, and it's trying to manage a whole bunch of relationships. So one function is changing a variable, and then that same function is doing something else to another variable. And at some point, the logic of our code starts looking very, very spaghetti like. And it's at this point where it's really hard to track and remember what's actually going on in our code. So this style of programming is called <a href=\"#\"><b>Procedural Programming</b></a> where we set up procedures or functions that do particular things. And then one procedure leads to another procedure, and all in all, the computer's mostly working from top to bottom and then jumping out into a function as needed.<br/><br/>Procedural programming is one of the earliest paradigms of Programming. In fact, back in the days when we had older languages like Fortran and COBOL, they rely pretty much exclusively on procedural programming like what we've been doing. But the increase in complexity, the increase in the number of relationships that we need to remember and manage starts making it look a bit like the dating history of the Kardashians.

Just have a cup of tea or have a nap, or just go to sleep and try to tackle it tomorrow. You will be surprised just how much easier things are when your brains had some downtime and then you come back to it. Everything seems so much more obvious.</td>\n",

    "        <td>And if you really, really get stuck and you just can't see it, ask a friend, not your friend print(), but your actual friend, a real human. Preferably a developer, but they don't have to be. It could be somebody who's taking the course with you. You could go onto discord and find other students to help you, because after all you're all just leveling up your own programming skills right? The really good thing about asking a friend to look through your code is they won't make the same assumptions that you've made. So they have some fresh eyes that they can look at the code with, and it might be incredibly obvious what's actually happening. And it's really not embarrassing at all. If somebody managed to help you with your code, you can offer to help them the next time when they get stuck. And for the person who's helping you, they're also just working out their programming muscles, right?</td>\n",

    "        <td>And the next tip is to run often. No, you don't have to go exercising to be a good programmer. But what I mean is run your code often. Don't wait until you've written loads and loads of code to hit run and then find out you've got loads of snags and loads of bugs. But run it after every little execution. Once you feel like you've changed the program ever so slightly, run it. Confirm that it's actually doing what you want it to do, because if you leave it all to the end, then you end up with a pile of bugs and you don't know where to start. Now, if you do end up in that situation and you can see multiple bugs at the same time, try to tackle them one at a time instead of trying to do bits and bobs of each. It will really, really help.</td>\n",

    "        <td>And the final tip is, of course, Stack Overflow. I've saved this the last because you really don't want to take every single small bug of yours to Stack Overflow, that's not what it's designed for. Instead, it's really designed as a way of asking other developers when you think that you've come across a bug or an issue that should be unique. Now, if you think that you issue isn't unique and other people should have encountered, then just search Stack Overflow. If you really think that nobody in the world has had an issue that you are having right now, then that's the moment to ask the Stack Overflow. I've worked in a lot of companies where everybody just goes to the part when Stack Overflow is down, because there's just no point. As programmers we use it and we search it so much and it's become a really vital tool in the tool belt. But you only wanna ask a question when you've pretty sure that you've exhausted all other avenues of debugging and you've searched all of Stack Overflow and you finally end up with something very strange and very weird that you want others to help you figure out. So don't worry about creating bugs. It doesn't mean that you are bad programmer. In fact, it's an important part of every programmer's journey. Just as a sort of personal note, there was a point in time where I've really thought that I was not a programmer of code, that I was just programmer of bugs. It seemed like every line of code I wrote was a bug.</td>\n",
