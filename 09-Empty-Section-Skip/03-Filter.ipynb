    "`filter()` is a built-in function in Python that is used to filter elements in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) based on a specific function that returns True or False. This function is very useful when we want to filter the elements in an iterable according to certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `filter()` offers a convenient way to filter out all the elements of an iterable, for which the function returns True. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The basic syntax of the `filter()` function is as follows:**\n",
    "```py\n",
    "filter(function, iterables)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **function:** A function used to test each element in the iterable. **This function must return a True or False value**.\n",
    "* **iterable:** The object to be iterated and filtered (such as a list, tuple, set, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like `map()`, `filter()` returns an ***iterator*** - that is, filter yields one result at a time as needed. Iterators and generators will be covered in an upcoming lecture. For now, since our examples are so small, we will cast `filter()` as a list to see our results immediately."

It is especially useful in situations where you want to extract elements from an iterable that meet certain conditions. However, depending on the need, list comprehension can also be a simpler and more readable alternative."
