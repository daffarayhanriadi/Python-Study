    "Welcome back Agent. Often you will have to deal with PDF files. There are [many libraries in Python for working with PDFs](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/manipulating-pdfs-with-python/167), each with their pros and cons, the most common one being **PyPDF2**. You can install it with (note the case-sensitivity, you need to make sure your capitilization matches):\n",

    "Keep in mind that not every PDF file can be read with this library. PDFs that are too blurry, have a special encoding, encrypted, or maybe just created with a particular program that doesn't work well with PyPDF2 won't be able to be read. If you find yourself in this situation, try using the libraries linked above, but keep in mind, these may also not work. The reason for this is because of the many different parameters for a PDF and how non-standard the settings can be, text could be shown as an image instead of a utf-8 encoding. There are many parameters to consider in this aspect.\n",

Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via workplace diversity and empowerment. Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring. Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line. Podcasting operational change management inside of workﬂows to establish a framework. Taking seamless key performance indicators ofﬂine to maximise the long tail. Keeping your eye on the ball while performing a deep dive on the start-up mentality to derive convergence on cross-platform integration. Collaboratively administrate empowered markets via plug-and-play networks. Dynamically procrastinate B2C users after installed base beneﬁts. Dramatically visualize customer directed convergence without revolutionary ROI. Efﬁciently unleash cross-media information without cross-media value. Quickly maximize timely deliverables for real-time schemas. Dramatically maintain clicks-and-mortar solutions without functional solutions. BUSINESS PROPOSAL!1'"
